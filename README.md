## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## How to play the game

The objective of the game is to test your memory. It is easy to play. Click on a card to open it and click on another and look at the card's picture. If the pictures on both cards matched, the cards will remain open. Otherwise they will close. Repeat the process and try to remember which cards has what picture and match it when you see the other picture. The game ends when all cards are opened. The game includes statistical numbers like how many moves or clicks have you made and it takes away stars as the click number gets bigger. The game is also timed. The game has a reset icon in case you want to restart the current game.  Have fun!
